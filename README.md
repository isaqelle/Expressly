    The Expressly App is designed to assist individuals who have difficulty communicating their emotions and thoughts. This user-friendly application enables users to express themselves through buttons.
    It is particularly beneficial for individuals with non-verbal autism, communication disorders, cognitive impairments, and learning disabilities.
    To achive this, the app provides a simple interface with 6 different emoji buttons that represent different emotions. Expressly does also provide a simple diary to help users reflect over their daily activities and the emotions than can be associated with them.
    Further, the user can look at the history of their emotions and activities in a calendar view.

This app is developed to support and improve mental health, more specifically it is focusing on SDG goal 3.4:
<em>

<blockquote>
By 2030, reduce by one third premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-being.
</blockquote></em>
